				<h3>Work</h3>
					<h3>Zynga — San Francisco, CA</h3>
						<h4><i>Software Engineer (Jan 2015 - July 2015)</i></h4>
							<h4><small>As a Software Developer at Zynga, I worked on Cross Platform Game development using the Unity Game Studio. I created and developed several services and features for the mobile game Zynga Poker as part of a team. Many of these features were released in the Production app, and are currently being used by millions of users.</small></h4>
							<h4><small>I gained experience in working with the Unity Game Studio, C# and Mono, and backend languages such as PHP and JavaScript. Most of the features I worked on were full scale and comprised multiple areas of the development platform.</small></h4>
							<h4><small>As a member of a small team, I gained experience in how to work alongside other developers and engineers. As a team, we worked on several features that required long hours of development. We completed our work in a shorter period of time by working on different components that tied together while maintaining coherence to make sure that each member of the team contributed to, and was aware of the final product.</small></h4>
						<h4><i>Software Engineering Intern (May 2014 - Aug 2014)</i></h4>
							<h4><small>As an Intern at Zynga, I worked on the Web game Zynga Poker. I worked with other members and interns in my team to develop features for the live game. I worked on backend services for many features, and gained first hand experience in PHP, JavaScript, and Java as a server language.</small></h4>
							<h4><small>Me and my Intern team also worked on a Creative Project for a new game. We developed a prototype for a Sports-oriented betting game that would have been part of the Poker game. Our team was awarded 3rd place in the competetion.
