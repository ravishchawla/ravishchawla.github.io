			<h3>Android Apps</h3>
				<h3><small>Developed and published different apps on the Google Play store, that used different backend technologies and services, 
					such as the Parse backend framework for cloud data storage, and Ad monetization through Google's AdMob platform</small></h3>	
				<p>App Link: <a href=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.stacksmashers.greenbook>Greenbook - Money management app</a></p>

			<h3>Page Rank</h3>
				<h3><small>Wrote Map reduce algorithms for Big data processing for Page Rank in Hadoop, to process the Wikipedia page-links dataset and Twitter-Memetracket dataset. 
						   The page rank algorithm ranked websites based on how many other websites link to it, by treating hyperlinks as edges and websites as nodes. 
						   The data collected from the Map Reduce implementation was then evaluated against an Apache Giraph implementation to compare memory and speed processing of the algorithms.

			<h3>BitTorrent Application</h3>
				<h3><small>Developed a BitTorrent application in C#, that can download and upload torrent files from secure trackers. The application 
						   used a Bencoding library to read torrent file data, and connected to peers using a persistent TCP connection. File download
						   took place with parallel unchoked connections to multiple peers, and handled for packet corruption, and uploaded file chunks 
						   as they were received.

			<h3>Games in C and C#/XNA</h3>
				<h3><small>Developed games with C for small 8-bit processors, employing Direct memory access for display. 
						   <br></br>Also developed several games in C# with XNA, that worked with an XBOX-360 Game controller for player movement.

			<h3>ETL Workflow Optimization</h3>
				<h3><small>Researched Optimization in the ETL workflow process, used for processing and loading data into Data Warehouses. 
						   Examined different areas and methods of optimization, which included heuristic and exhaustive methods, and compared overall improved performance
						   between them and other proposed approaches. Also looked at what current research and being conducted for this topic, and how it is being used 
						   in the industry.

			<h3>ArangoDB</h3>
				<h3><small>Researched a new NoSQL Technology called ArangoDB, which provides Graph data storage in terms of nodes and edges, 
						   as well as documents. Compared it to other databases, such as CouchDB and MongoDB, analysing what features they provide, 
						   and how performance compares between each for large amounts of data.
