			<h3>Social Hub for Zynga Poker</h3>
				<h3><small>Worked on a Social Hub for the Mobile Game Zynga Poker. The Social Hub (currently in Production) is an area of the game which allows all users to interact with their game buddies, people they have played with recently on the table, and their Facebook friends.</small></h3>
				<h3><small>I developed several backend services and front-end components for this feature that provided core functionality. One of these was a pane for displaying Recent Player information. Because information about a users' friend was stored in different databases, the backend data had to be properly structured and validated.</small></h3>
				<h3><small>Another feature I worked on was a Player Block feature. I worked on all areas of this project, ranging from creating the front-end UI Components to the backend services that implemented important API calls. The data was stored In a sharded database, and functions were written to store and retrieve proper data, after authentication and user authorization, from the data store.</small></h3>
				<p>Game Link (which has this feature) on the iOS App Store <a href=https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/zynga-poker-texas-holdem/id354902315?mt=8>Zynga Poker</a></p>

			<h3>Campus Exchange</h3>
				<h3><small>Worked on a Campus-oriented marketplace for students in different Universities. The application was developed for Web only. One of our main goals was to create a strong backend foundation so that other developers on our campus could utilize it to develop more apps using the same central service.</small></h3>
				<h3><small>Designed and developed a fully functioning REST Api in PHP that integrated with a backend CouchDB Database hosted on Amazon servers</small></h3>
    			<h3><small>Provided Endpoints for Proper user Authorization and Authentication, Query-based searches, and File uploads to External servers while following the Restful architectural style</small></h3>
    			<h3><small>Helped on properly integrating the API with a Web Application developed using the Angular.js framework</small></h3>

    		<h3>Happening - Events based Social Network for mobile</h3>
    			<h3><small>Worked on a potential Startup based on an Events based Social Network. We realized a need for an important Events finder on our campus, and worked on this project to provide this functionality to students at Georgia Tech.</small></h3>
    			<h3><small>Developed a Restful API using Node.js and a MongoDB hosted on AWS services</small></h3>
				<h3><small>Developed Native Android application that worked with backend services to display and manipulate data, using the REST Api, and other third party APIs, including Facebook Graph API</small></h3>
				<h3><small>Developed a Web application using Node.js and Express.js frontend, that used Backend REST API services and HTML5 Location services </small></h3>
			<hr></hr>
			<h3>Android Apps</h3>
				<h3><small>Developed and published different apps on the Google Play store, that used different backend technologies and services, 
					such as the Parse backend framework for cloud data storage, and Ad monetization through Google's AdMob platform</small></h3>	
				<p>App Link: <a href=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id/=com.stacksmashers.greenbook>Greenbook - Money management app</a></p>

			<h3>Page Rank</h3>
				<h3><small>Wrote Map reduce algorithms for Big data processing for Page Rank in Hadoop, to process the Wikipedia page-links dataset and Twitter-Memetracket dataset. 
						   The page rank algorithm ranked websites based on how many other websites link to it, by treating hyperlinks as edges and websites as nodes. 
						   The data collected from the Map Reduce implementation was then evaluated against an Apache Giraph implementation to compare memory and speed processing of the algorithms.

			<h3>BitTorrent Application</h3>
				<h3><small>Developed a BitTorrent application in C#, that can download and upload torrent files from secure trackers. The application 
						   used a Bencoding library to read torrent file data, and connected to peers using a persistent TCP connection. File download
						   took place with parallel unchoked connections to multiple peers, and handled for packet corruption, and uploaded file chunks 
						   as they were received.

			<h3>Games in C and C#/XNA</h3>
				<h3><small>Developed games with C for small 8-bit processors, employing Direct memory access for display. 
						   <br></br>Also developed several games in C# with XNA, that worked with an XBOX-360 Game controller for player movement.

			<h3>ETL Workflow Optimization</h3>
				<h3><small>Researched Optimization in the ETL workflow process, used for processing and loading data into Data Warehouses. 
						   Examined different areas and methods of optimization, which included heuristic and exhaustive methods, and compared overall improved performance
						   between them and other proposed approaches. Also looked at what current research and being conducted for this topic, and how it is being used 
						   in the industry.

			<h3>ArangoDB</h3>
				<h3><small>Researched a new NoSQL Technology called ArangoDB, which provides Graph data storage in terms of nodes and edges, 
						   as well as documents. Compared it to other databases, such as CouchDB and MongoDB, analysing what features they provide, 
						   and how performance compares between each for large amounts of data.
